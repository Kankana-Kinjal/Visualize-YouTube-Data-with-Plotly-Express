# YouTube Subscriber Data Visualization (EDA)

## About the Project
This project is a beginner-level Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project.  
The goal of this project is to understand how YouTube channel subscribers are distributed and to identify patterns using data visualization.

The analysis focuses on the most subscribed YouTube channels.

---

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle  
- The dataset contains information about popular YouTube channels and their subscriber counts.

---

## What I Did in This Project
- Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
- Cleaned and analyzed subscriber data
- Created interactive visualizations to understand the data better

---

## Visualizations Used
- **Histogram** – to understand the distribution of subscriber counts  
- **Box Plot** – to identify outliers and extreme values  
- **Pie Chart** – to show the proportional contribution of top channels  

---

## Key Insights
- Subscriber data is **right-skewed**, meaning most channels have lower subscribers while a few channels have very high subscribers
- Box plots show **outliers**, which represent extremely popular YouTube channels
- A small number of channels contribute a large portion of total subscribers

---

## Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Plotly Express  
- Google Colab

## Conclusion
This project helped me understand how to perform basic exploratory data analysis and data visualization using real-world data.  
It also helped me learn how to interpret charts and explain insights clearly.
